This program doesn't change the file size,
and it doesn't account for if another program
added or deleted bytes. If you add or delete a byte
in the file, the addresses in a category file will be off.

I don't have a lot of documentation yet, so see
the sample files I have provided.

The text features of this program (see categoryfilestructure.txt)
use ASCII. Not the most flexible choice...

IMPORTANT: The text editor also hasn't been tested yet.
Use at your own risk
